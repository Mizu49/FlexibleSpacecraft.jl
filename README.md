Our focus is the coupling problem of structural vibration and spacecraft attitude. The structural and attitude control systems of spacecraft have been treated as separate problems. However, the coupled structure-attitude dynamic analysis will be necessary for the next generation spacecraft with extensive and flexible structures envisioned in the future. A simulator of the structure-attitude coupling system will make it possible to verify the problem efficiently and accelerate the development of the next-generation spacecraft.

*This project is quite new and under active development for open-source release.*
