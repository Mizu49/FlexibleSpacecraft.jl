# FlexibleSpacecraft.jl Documentation

`FlexibleSpacecraft.jl` is **an Open Source Spacecraft Attitude-Structure Coupling Simulator** developed in Julia Language.

Our focus is the coupling problem of structural vibration and spacecraft attitude. The structural and attitude control systems of spacecraft have been treated as separate problems. However, the coupled structure-attitude dynamic analysis will be necessary for the next generation spacecraft with extensive and flexible structures envisioned in the future. A simulator of the structure-attitude coupling system will make it possible to verify the problem efficiently and accelerate the development of the next-generation spacecraft.

*This project is quite new and under active development for open-source release.*
