# Structural analysis of the flexible appendages

`FlexibleSpacecraft.jl` offers an extensive simulation features to simulate the structural motion of the flexible appendages of the spacecraft. The submodule `Structures.jl` is the high-level module for the simulation regarding the structural dynamics. This page provides the overview of the components that consists of the `Structures.jl`.
